This repo contains 3 differents programs and all are about the appliction of the concepts that are abstraction and interface.
The package Exercice1 is about the application of the abstraction concept.
And the 2  other packages are about interfaces.
ArrayLists are also applied here. Adding, viewing items, etc.
And at the end of each packages, we have a tester class to implement all of our classes and see the results.
We used Microsoft Visio for te UML Classes diagrams.
